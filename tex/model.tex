The model as is:

\begin{displaymath}
p(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-g(x)}}
\end{displaymath}

The vector x, computed at a reference time $t$ is composed of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Time since last commit $= T(t)$

\item exponentially weighted moving averages of commit rates over time scales $\tau_i$. These are $c(\tau_i, t)$. These go as:
\begin{displaymath}
c(\tau_i, t ) = c(\tau_i, t - T) e^{-k_i T}
\end{displaymath}

\item Diversity metrics. Since these are all ratios of exponentially weighted moving averages with the same lifetime, there is no change in these during a no-commits gap.

\item Past Commits. The total number of past commits does not change during a no-commits gap.

\item Age. The age of the repository increases linearly with T. Supposing $t_0$ is the age at the time of the most recent commit, Age $= t_0 + T$. 

\end{itemize}

Therefore the part of $g(x)$ that depends on $T$ looks like:

\begin{displaymath}
b_{T}T + \sum_i b_{c(\tau_i)} c(\tau_i, t-T) e^{-k_i T} + b_{age}T
\end{displaymath}
