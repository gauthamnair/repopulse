thoughts on the pipeline:

I have at the moment two sources of data
for a repository:
the repo itself, which contains language and owner, 
but no other historical data.

the weekly commits,
which have author-level resolution.


First stage of feature extraction:
from database to per repo summary statistics
the aim is to have just one

def getFeaturesFromWeeklyContributions():
	pass

def buildTrainingSet():
	pass
